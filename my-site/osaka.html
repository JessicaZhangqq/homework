            <h3>Osaka Castle Park</h3>
            <p>I used to walk to Osaka Castle Park from my apartment which located two stops away. I walked at the park.
                I coulde spend several hours just walking around. Standing at riverside watching fish swimming around, or
                sitting at a bench observing tourists taking photo.
            </p>

                 <h3>Umeda</h3>
                 <p>One of my part time job is at Umeda Centre, I went there ridding bicycle in the morning. I discovered
                     different routs from my apartment to workplace. I got lost serveral time due to the streets at Umeda area are super complicated, it's easy 
                     to get lost. You can go there by Metro, but there are 3 stations. There are many shopping malls. Products 
                     of there are usually more expensive that in other place.
